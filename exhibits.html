                                The Museum’s collection of historic European and American art was shaped by
                                 James Bowdoin III, the founder of the College, who bequeathed family collections
                                  of European art in 1811. Subsequent generations have built on this legacy and 
                                  collecting continues to this day. This exhibition brings together works from 
                                  Bowdoin’s collection with important recent acquisitions that offer new perspectives
                                on the art of Europe and the transatlantic colonies.

                                <p class="card-text">1648, oil on panel. <br></br> 
                                    A gathering of fisherfolk peddling their catch dominates the foreground. 
                                    The artist’s mastery of perspective is employed here by contrasting the 
                                    foreground fisherfolk with diminutive figures near the distant water’s edge. 
                                    All of this human activity occurs under a superbly rendered cloudy sky in which 
                                    the light playing across the scene seems to be constantly shifting, energizing 
                                    the painting to brilliant pictorial effect. Simon de Vlieger was responsible 
                                    for the transition from the spirited beginnings of Dutch marine art to its most
                                     august and refined stage in the years around 1650. His great predecessor, Jan 
                                     Porcellis, shifted Dutch marine art away from large-scale history subjects to 
                                     focus instead on the unique atmospheric effects of the sea. De Vlieger brought 
                                     these innovations to new levels of refinement by envisaging the constant yet 
                                     ever-changing rhythm of the sea under vaulting clouds that filter the 
                                     sunlight playing across land and sea.

                                    In "The Burning of Sodom" a high horizon line combines with an elevated foreground to reveal a sweeping panorama—
                                    a composition favored by Flemish painters of the time. Color helps define depth, with a reddish brown hue in the 
                                    foreground, followed by green and blue shades in the middle and background. In the Book of Genesis, the cities of 
                                    Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed when God condemned their inhabitants for their lascivious lifestyles. Angels were
                                     sent to the city of Sodom, but unable to find ten righteous people there to rescue, they called upon Lot, Abraham’s
                                      nephew, and led him and his family from the city. The only stipulation was that they must not look back at their 
                                      burning home. When Lot’s wife disobeyed, she was turned into a pillar of salt. Two distraught daughters got Lot drunk, 
                                      as seen in the foreground, and then enticed him to father their children.

                                    Hendrik Cornelisz. Van Vliet, Dutch, 1611-1675. <br></br>
                                    1667, oil on canvas.<br></br>
                                    In mid-seventeenth-century Delft, Hendrick Cornelisz. van Vliet was one of several painters who
                                    specialized in illusionistic renderings of the interiors of the city’s two great Gothic churches. In
                                    addition to the scrupulous investigation of the visual qualities of light and space, these views
                                    were also expressions of the pleasure of observation and national pride, drawing attention to the
                                    memorials of the heroes in Holland’s recent struggle with Spain. The figures in the composition
                                    serve as more than mere markers of scale, bringing life to this representation of the church,
                                    which served as one of the city’s important civic centers. The remarkable trompe l’oeil curtain in
                                    the far-right foreground cleverly plays with notions of surface and illusion and serves as a
                                    transition between the space of the viewer and the deep architectural volume of the interior.

                           drawing, print-making, photography, new media art, and various craft traditions. While many
                            works will come from the Museum's collection, the exhibition will also include important works
                             from other institutions, artists, and private collectors in Maine and beyond. The exhibition
