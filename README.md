# PQ4: Working Prototype 
Our working prototype features our home page with a clearly laid-out menu that features the functions that we intend to build: an about page, exhibitions page, visit, events & news, and a contact page. The main goal that we implemented for our PQ4 checkpoint was to allow users to perform the task of contacting staff at the museum with comments. For now, the only page that is functioning is the "contacts" link, after you click on contacts on the home index page. According to the interviews we conducted, we built a framework that allows users to also see the staff profiles when they arrive to the contact page. Then, the helpful menu would allow users to return to the contact page and leave comments, which would be sent in an email to the Bowdoin Museum of Art. Since we are in the early stages of the web design prototype, the email is currently "Jouya's Email" that we can change later to the museum email after our website is fully finished. 

Another goal that we accomplished was to make the discussion page more noticable by allowing a button on the home page for users to click and view discussion board without having to make an account. This is due to our interviewers, who pointed out the fact that the discussion board is really hard to access, so we made it more visible for viewers to see.

For now, our prototype provides a clear layout of the home page and contact us page for users to navigate between, with a focus on the function task of being able to contact someone at the museum.
